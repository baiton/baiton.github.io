Thanks for Checking out my WebPage.

I use Scroll Magic and CSS for the animated content.
Viro Media for my AR application.

All Pixel art and animations are created in Pixaki.
Any wireframes you find will have been created in Concepts.

Finally the base layout for my website was from a template at Themewagon but all content has been stylized and reorganized by me.  I do plan on creating my website from scratch over the course of the next few weeks.


Thanks again for checking out my code I hope my hard work pays off ;P
